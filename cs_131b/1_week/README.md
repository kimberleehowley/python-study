### 1: Why should you learn to write programs? 
* Computers contain: 
  * Central processing unit (CPU): The part of the computer that executes programs (asks "What's next?").
  * Main memory: Stores information the CPU needs quickly; info disappears if computer off.
  * Secondary memory: Slower than main memory, but can store info even if computer off. 
  * Input/output: keyboard, mouse, mic, etc. 
  * Network connection: Way to retrieve data. 
* Programmers write instructions for "What's next?" that are stored in a computer's main memory. 
* Reserved words in Python are like words that humans can use to communicate with dogs: a dog won't understand everything, but knows keywords like "sit" or "stay". Those words can't be used to make the dog understand anything but their first understanding, or, we can't use reserved words for anything other than reserved words' purposes in Python. They have only one meaning.
