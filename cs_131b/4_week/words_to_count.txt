    dictatorial political state is the direct offspring of scientific
    materialism and philosophic secularism. Secularism no sooner frees man from
    the domination of the institutionalized church than it sells him into
    slavish bondage to the totalitarian state. Secularism frees man from
    ecclesiastical slavery only to betray him into the tyranny of political and
    economic slavery.



      195:8.5 Materialism denies God, secularism simply ignores him; at least
    that was the earlier attitude. More recently, secularism has assumed a more
    militant attitude, assuming to take the place of the religion whose
    totalitarian bondage it onetime resisted. Twentieth-century secularism
    tends to affirm that man does not need God. But beware! this godless
    philosophy of human society will lead only to unrest, animosity,
    unhappiness, war, and world-wide disaster.



      195:8.6 Secularism can never bring peace to mankind. Nothing can take
    the place of God in human society. But mark you well! do not be quick to
    surrender the beneficent gains of the secular revolt from ecclesiastical
    totalitarianism. Western civilization today enjoys many liberties and
    satisfactions as a result of the secular revolt. The great mistake of
    secularism was this: In revolting against the almost total control of life
    by religious authority, and after attaining the liberation from such
    ecclesiastical tyranny, the secularists went on to institute a revolt
    against God himself, sometimes tacitly and sometimes openly.

      195:8.7 To the secularistic revolt you owe the amazing creativity of
    American industrialism and the unprecedented material progress of Western
    civilization. And because the secularistic revolt went too far and lost
    sight of God and true religion, there also followed the unlooked-for
    harvest of world wars and international unsettledness.

      195:8.8 It is not necessary to sacrifice faith in God in order to enjoy
    the blessings of the modern secularistic revolt: tolerance, social service,
    democratic government, and civil liberties. It was not necessary for the
    secularists to antagonize true religion in order to promote science and to
    advance education.

      195:8.9 But secularism is not the sole parent of all these recent gains
    in the enlargement of living. Behind the gains of the twentieth century are
    not only science and secularism but also the unrecognized and
    unacknowledged spiritual workings of the life and teaching of Jesus of
    Nazareth.

      195:8.10 Without God, without religion, scientific secularism can never
    co-ordinate its forces, harmonize its divergent and rivalrous interests,
    races, and nationalisms. This secularistic human society, notwithstanding
    its unparalleled materialistic achievement, is slowly disintegrating. The
    chief cohesive force resisting this disintegration of antagonism is
    nationalism. And nationalism is the chief barrier to world peace.

      195:8.11 The inherent weakness of secularism is that it discards ethics
    and religion for politics and power. You simply cannot establish the
    brotherhood of men while ignoring or denying the fatherhood of God.

      195:8.12 Secular social and political optimism is an illusion. Without
    God, neither freedom and liberty, nor property and wealth will lead to
    peace.

      195:8.13 The complete secularization of science, education, industry,
    and society can lead only to disaster. During the first third of the
    twentieth century Urantians killed more human beings than were killed
    during the whole of the Christian dispensation up to that time. And this is
    only the beginning of the dire harvest of materialism and secularism; still
    more terrible destruction is yet to come.




                             9. CHRISTIANITY'S PROBLEM



      195:9.1 Do not overlook the value of your spiritual heritage, the river
    of truth running down through the centuries, even to the barren times of a
    materialistic and secular age. In all your worthy efforts to rid yourselves
    of the superstitious creeds of past ages, make sure that you hold fast the
    eternal truth. But be patient! when the present superstition revolt is
    over, the truths of Jesus' gospel will persist gloriously to illuminate a
    new and better way.

      195:9.2 But paganized and socialized Christianity stands in need of new
    contact with the uncompromised teachings of Jesus; it languishes for lack
    of a new vision of the Master's life on earth. A new and fuller revelation
    of the religion of Jesus is destined to conquer an empire of materialistic
    secularism and to overthrow a world sway of mechanistic naturalism. Urantia
    is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and
    enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual
    enlightenment.

      195:9.3 The teachings of Jesus, even though greatly modified, survived
    the mystery cults of their birthtime, the ignorance and superstition of the
    dark ages, and are even now slowly triumphing over the materialism,
    mechanism, and secularism of the twentieth century. And such times of great
    testing and threatened defeat are always times of great revelation.



      195:9.4 Religion does need new leaders, spiritual men and women who will
    dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings. If
    Christianity persists in neglecting its spiritual mission while it
    continues to busy itself with social and material problems, the spiritual
    renaissance must await the coming of these new teachers of Jesus' religion
    who will be exclusively devoted to the spiritual regeneration of men. And
    then will these spirit-born souls quickly supply the leadership and
    inspiration requisite for the social, moral, economic, and political
    reorganization of the world.

      195:9.5 The modern age will refuse to accept a religion which is
    inconsistent with facts and out of harmony with its highest conceptions of
    truth, beauty, and goodness. The hour is striking for a rediscovery of the
    true and original foundations of present-day distorted and compromised
    Christianity -- the real life and teachings of Jesus.



      195:9.6 Primitive man lived a life of superstitious bondage to religious
    fear. Modern, civilized men dread the thought of falling under the
    dominance of strong religious convictions. Thinking man has always feared
    to be held by a religion. When a strong and moving religion threatens to
    dominate him, he invariably tries to rationalize, traditionalize, and
    institutionalize it, thereby hoping to gain control of it. By such
    procedure, even a revealed religion becomes man-made and man-dominated.
    Modern men and women of intelligence evade the religion of Jesus because of
    their fears of what it will do to them -- and with them. And all such fears
    are well founded. The religion of Jesus does, indeed, dominate and
    transform its believers, demanding that men dedicate their lives to seeking
    for a knowledge of the will of the Father in heaven and requiring that the
    energies of living be consecrated to the unselfish service of the
    brotherhood of man.

      195:9.7 Selfish men and women simply will not pay such a price for even
    the greatest spiritual treasure ever offered mortal man. Only when man has
    become sufficiently disillusioned by the sorrowful disappointments
    attendant upon the foolish and deceptive pursuits of selfishness, and
    subsequent to the discovery of the barrenness of formalized religion, will
    he be disposed to turn wholeheartedly to the gospel of the kingdom, the
    religion of Jesus of Nazareth.

      195:9.8 The world needs more firsthand religion. Even Christianity --
    the best of the religions of the twentieth century -- is not only a
    religion about Jesus, but it is so largely one which men experience
    secondhand. They take their religion wholly as handed down by their
    accepted religious teachers. What an awakening the world would experience
    if it could only see Jesus as he really lived on earth and know, firsthand,
    his life-giving teachings! Descriptive words of things beautiful cannot
    thrill like the sight thereof, neither can creedal words inspire men's
    souls like the experience of knowing the presence of God. But expectant
    faith will ever keep the hope-door of man's soul open for the entrance of
    the eternal spiritual realities of the divine values of the worlds beyond.



      195:9.9 Christianity has dared to lower its ideals before the challenge
    of human greed, war-madness, and the lust for power; but the religion of
    Jesus stands as the unsullied and transcendent spiritual summons, calling
    to the best there is in man to rise above all these legacies of animal
    evolution and, by grace, attain the moral heights of true human destiny.

      195:9.10 Christianity is threatened by slow death from formalism,
    overorganization, intellectualism, and other nonspiritual trends. The
    modern Christian church is not such a brotherhood of dynamic believers as
    Jesus commissioned continuously to effect the spiritual transformation of
    successive generations of mankind.

      195:9.11 So-called Christianity has become a social and cultural
    movement as well as a religious belief and practice. The stream of modern
    Christianity drains many an ancient pagan swamp and many a barbarian
    morass; many olden cultural watersheds drain into this present-day cultural
    stream as well as the high Galilean tablelands which are supposed to be its
    exclusive source.




                                  10. THE FUTURE



      195:10.1 Christianity has indeed done a great service for this world,
    but what is now most needed is Jesus. The world needs to see Jesus living
    again on earth in the experience of spirit-born mortals who effectively
    reveal the Master to all men. It is futile to talk about a revival of
    primitive Christianity; you must go forward from where you find yourselves.
    Modern culture must become spiritually baptized with a new revelation of
    Jesus' life and illuminated with a new understanding of his gospel of
    eternal salvation. And when Jesus becomes thus lifted up, he will draw all
    men to himself. Jesus' disciples should be more than conquerors, even
    overflowing sources of inspiration and enhanced living to all men. Religion
    is only an exalted humanism until it is made divine by the discovery of the
    reality of the presence of God in personal experience.

      195:10.2 The beauty and sublimity, the humanity and divinity, the
    simplicity and uniqueness, of Jesus' life on earth present such a striking
    and appealing picture of man-saving and God-revealing that the theologians
    and philosophers of all time should be effectively restrained from daring
    to form creeds or create theological systems of spiritual bondage out of
    such a transcendental bestowal of God in the form of man. In Jesus the
    universe produced a mortal man in whom the spirit of love triumphed over
    the material handicaps of time and overcame the fact of physical origin.



      195:10.3 Ever bear in mind -- God and men need each other. They are
    mutually necessary to the full and final attainment of eternal personality
    experience in the divine destiny of universe finality.

      195:10.4 "The kingdom of God is within you" was probably the greatest
    pronouncement Jesus ever made, next to the declaration that his Father is a
    living and loving spirit.



      195:10.5 In winning souls for the Master, it is not the first mile of
    compulsion, duty, or convention that will transform man and his world, but
    rather the second mile of free service and liberty-loving devotion that
    betokens the Jesusonian reaching forth to grasp his brother in love and
    sweep him on under spiritual guidance toward the higher and divine goal of
    mortal existence. Christianity even now willingly goes the first mile, but
    mankind languishes and stumbles along in moral darkness because there are
    so few genuine second-milers -- so few professed followers of Jesus who
    really live and love as he taught his disciples to live and love and serve.

      195:10.6 The call to the adventure of building a new and transformed
    human society by means of the spiritual rebirth of Jesus' brotherhood of
    the kingdom should thrill all who believe in him as men have not been
    stirred since the days when they walked about on earth as his companions in
    the flesh.

      195:10.7 No social system or political regime which denies the reality
    of God can contribute in any constructive and lasting manner to the
    advancement of human civilization. But Christianity, as it is subdivided
    and secularized today, presents the greatest single obstacle to its further
    advancement; especially is this true concerning the Orient.



      195:10.8 Ecclesiasticism is at once and forever incompatible with that
    living faith, growing spirit, and firsthand experience of the
    faith-comrades of Jesus in the brotherhood of man in the spiritual
    association of the kingdom of heaven. The praiseworthy desire to preserve
    traditions of past achievement often leads to the defense of outgrown
    systems of worship. The well-meant desire to foster ancient thought systems
    effectually prevents the sponsoring of new and adequate means and methods
    designed to satisfy the spiritual longings of the expanding and advancing
    minds of modern men. Likewise, the Christian churches of the twentieth
    century stand as great, but wholly unconscious, obstacles to the immediate
    advance of the real gospel -- the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.

      195:10.9 Many earnest persons who would gladly yield loyalty to the
    Christ of the gospel find it very difficult enthusiastically to support a
    church which exhibits so little of the spirit of his life and teachings,
    and which they have been erroneously taught he founded. Jesus did not found
    the so-called Christian church, but he has, in every manner consistent with
    his nature, fostered it as the best existent exponent of his lifework on
    earth.

      195:10.10 If the Christian church would only dare to espouse the
    Master's program, thousands of apparently indifferent youths would rush
    forward to enlist in such a spiritual undertaking, and they would not
    hesitate to go all the way through with this great adventure.

      195:10.11 Christianity is seriously confronted with the doom embodied in
    one of its own slogans: "A house divided against itself cannot stand." The
    non-Christian world will hardly capitulate to a sect-divided Christendom.
    The living Jesus is the only hope of a possible unification of
    Christianity. The true church -- the Jesus brotherhood -- is invisible,
    spiritual, and is characterized by unity, not necessarily by uniformity.
    Uniformity is the earmark of the physical world of mechanistic nature.
    Spiritual unity is the fruit of faith union with the living Jesus. The
    visible church should refuse longer to handicap the progress of the
    invisible and spiritual brotherhood of the kingdom of God. And this
    brotherhood is destined to become a living organism in contrast to an
    institutionalized social organization. It may well utilize such social
    organizations, but it must not be supplanted by them.

      195:10.12 But the Christianity of even the twentieth century must not be
    despised. It is the product of the combined moral genius of the God-knowing
    men of many races during many ages, and it has truly been one of the
    greatest powers for good on earth, and therefore no man should lightly
    regard it, notwithstanding its inherent and acquired defects. Christianity
    still contrives to move the minds of reflective men with mighty moral
    emotions.

      195:10.13 But there is no excuse for the involvement of the church in
    commerce and politics; such unholy alliances are a flagrant betrayal of the
    Master. And the genuine lovers of truth will be slow to forget that this
    powerful institutionalized church has often dared to smother newborn faith
    and persecute truth bearers who chanced to appear in unorthodox raiment.

      195:10.14 It is all too true that such a church would not have survived
    unless there had been men in the world who preferred such a style of
    worship. Many spiritually indolent souls crave an ancient and authoritative
    religion of ritual and sacred traditions. Human evolution and spiritual
    progress are hardly sufficient to enable all men to dispense with religious
    authority. And the invisible brotherhood of the kingdom may well include
    these family groups of various social and temperamental classes if they are
    only willing to become truly spirit-led sons of God. But in this
    brotherhood of Jesus there is no place for sectarian rivalry, group
    bitterness, nor assertions of moral superiority and spiritual
    infallibility.

      195:10.15 These various groupings of Christians may serve to accommodate
    numerous different types of would-be believers among the various peoples of
    Western civilization, but such division of Christendom presents a grave
    weakness when it attempts to carry the gospel of Jesus to Oriental peoples.
    These races do not yet understand that there is a religion of Jesus
    separate, and somewhat apart, from Christianity, which has more and more
    become a religion about Jesus.

      195:10.16 The great hope of Urantia lies in the possibility of a new
    revelation of Jesus with a new and enlarged presentation of his saving
    message which would spiritually unite in loving service the numerous
    families of his present-day professed followers.

      195:10.17 Even secular education could help in this great spiritual
    renaissance if it would pay more attention to the work of teaching youth
    how to engage in life planning and character progression. The purpose of
    all education should be to foster and further the supreme purpose of life,
    the development of a majestic and well-balanced personality. There is great
    need for the teaching of moral discipline in the place of so much
    self-gratification. Upon such a foundation religion may contribute its
    spiritual incentive to the enlargement and enrichment of mortal life, even
    to the security and enhancement of life eternal.

      195:10.18 Christianity is an extemporized religion, and therefore must
    it operate in low gear. High-gear spiritual performances must await the new
    revelation and the more general acceptance of the real religion of Jesus.
    But Christianity is a mighty religion, seeing that the commonplace
    disciples of a crucified carpenter set in motion those teachings which
    conquered the Roman world in three hundred years and then went on to
    triumph over the barbarians who overthrew Rome. This same Christianity
    conquered -- absorbed and exalted -- the whole stream of Hebrew theology
    and Greek philosophy. And then, when this Christian religion became
    comatose for more than a thousand years as a result of an overdose of
    mysteries and paganism, it resurrected itself and virtually reconquered the
    whole Western world. Christianity contains enough of Jesus' teachings to
    immortalize it.

      195:10.19 If Christianity could only grasp more of Jesus' teachings, it
    could do so much more in helping modern man to solve his new and
    increasingly complex problems.

      195:10.20 Christianity suffers under a great handicap because it has
    become identified in the minds of all the world as a part of the social
    system, the industrial life, and the moral standards of Western
    civilization; and thus has Christianity unwittingly seemed to sponsor a
    society which staggers under the guilt of tolerating science without
    idealism, politics without principles, wealth without work, pleasure
    without restraint, knowledge without character, power without conscience,
    and industry without morality.

      195:10.21 The hope of modern Christianity is that it should cease to
    sponsor the social systems and industrial policies of Western civilization
    while it humbly bows itself before the cross it so valiantly extols, there
    to learn anew from Jesus of Nazareth the greatest truths mortal man can
    ever hear -- the living gospel of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood
    of man.

                                     PAPER 196

                                 THE FAITH OF JESUS



      196:0.1 JESUS enjoyed a sublime and wholehearted faith in God. He
    experienced the ordinary ups and downs of mortal existence, but he never
    religiously doubted the certainty of God's watchcare and guidance. His
    faith was the outgrowth of the insight born of the activity of the divine
    presence, his indwelling Adjuster. His faith was neither traditional nor
    merely intellectual; it was wholly personal and purely spiritual.

      196:0.2 The human Jesus saw God as being holy, just, and great, as well
    as being true, beautiful, and good. All these attributes of divinity he
    focused in his mind as the "will of the Father in heaven." Jesus' God was
    at one and the same time "The Holy One of Israel" and "The living and
    loving Father in heaven." The concept of God as a Father was not original
    with Jesus, but he exalted and elevated the idea into a sublime experience
    by achieving a new revelation of God and by proclaiming that every mortal
    creature is a child of this Father of love, a son of God.

      196:0.3 Jesus did not cling to faith in God as would a struggling soul
    at war with the universe and at death grips with a hostile and sinful
    world; he did not resort to faith merely as a consolation in the midst of
    difficulties or as a comfort in threatened despair; faith was not just an
    illusory compensation for the unpleasant realities and the sorrows of
    living. In the very face of all the natural difficulties and the temporal
    contradictions of mortal existence, he experienced the tranquillity of
    supreme and unquestioned trust in God and felt the tremendous thrill of
    living, by faith, in the very presence of the heavenly Father. And this
    triumphant faith was a living experience of actual spirit attainment.
    Jesus' great contribution to the values of human experience was not that he
    revealed so many new ideas about the Father in heaven, but rather that he
    so magnificently and humanly demonstrated a new and higher type of living
    faith in God. Never on all the worlds of this universe, in the life of any
    one mortal, did God ever become such a living reality as in the human
    experience of Jesus of Nazareth.

      196:0.4 In the Master's life on Urantia, this and all other worlds of
    the local creation discover a new and higher type of religion, religion
    based on personal spiritual relations with the Universal Father and wholly
    validated by the supreme authority of genuine personal experience. This
    living faith of Jesus was more than an intellectual reflection, and it was
    not a mystic meditation.

      196:0.5 Theology may fix, formulate, define, and dogmatize faith, but in
    the human life of Jesus faith was personal, living, original, spontaneous,
    and purely spiritual. This faith was not reverence for tradition nor a mere
    intellectual belief which he held as a sacred creed, but rather a sublime
    experience and a profound conviction which securely held him. His faith was
    so real and all-encompassing that it absolutely swept away any spiritual
    doubts and effectively destroyed every conflicting desire. Nothing was able
    to tear him away from the spiritual anchorage of this fervent, sublime, and
    undaunted faith. Even in the face of apparent defeat or in the throes of
    disappointment and threatening despair, he calmly stood in the divine
    presence free from fear and fully conscious of spiritual invincibility.
    Jesus enjoyed the invigorating assurance of the possession of unflinching
    faith, and in each of life's trying situations he unfailingly exhibited an
    unquestioning loyalty to the Father's will. And this superb faith was
    undaunted even by the cruel and crushing threat of an ignominious death.

      196:0.6 In a religious genius, strong spiritual faith so many times
    leads directly to disastrous fanaticism, to exaggeration of the religious
    ego, but it was not so with Jesus. He was not unfavorably affected in his
    practical life by his extraordinary faith and spirit attainment because
    this spiritual exaltation was a wholly unconscious and spontaneous soul
    expression of his personal experience with God.

      196:0.7 The all-consuming and indomitable spiritual faith of Jesus never
    became fanatical, for it never attempted to run away with his well-balanced
    intellectual judgments concerning the proportional values of practical and
    commonplace social, economic, and moral life situations. The Son of Man was
    a splendidly unified human personality; he was a perfectly endowed divine
    being; he was also magnificently co-ordinated as a combined human and
    divine being functioning on earth as a single personality. Always did the
    Master co-ordinate the faith of the soul with the wisdom-appraisals of
    seasoned experience. Personal faith, spiritual hope, and moral devotion
    were always correlated in a matchless religious unity of harmonious
    association with the keen realization of the reality and sacredness of all
    human loyalties -- personal honor, family love, religious obligation,
    social duty, and economic necessity.

      196:0.8 The faith of Jesus visualized all spirit values as being found
    in the kingdom of God; therefore he said, "Seek first the kingdom of
    heaven." Jesus saw in the advanced and ideal fellowship of the kingdom the
    achievement and fulfillment of the "will of God." The very heart of the
    prayer which he taught his disciples was, "Your kingdom come; your will be
    done." Having thus conceived of the kingdom as comprising the will of God,
    he devoted himself to the cause of its realization with amazing
    self-forgetfulness and unbounded enthusiasm. But in all his intense mission
    and throughout his extraordinary life there never appeared the fury of the
    fanatic nor the superficial frothiness of the religious egotist.

      196:0.9 The Master's entire life was consistently conditioned by this
    living faith, this sublime religious experience. This spiritual attitude
    wholly dominated his thinking and feeling, his believing and praying, his
    teaching and preaching. This personal faith of a son in the certainty and
    security of the guidance and protection of the heavenly Father imparted to
    his unique life a profound endowment of spiritual reality. And yet, despite
    this very deep consciousness of close relationship with divinity, this
    Galilean, God's Galilean, when addressed as Good Teacher, instantly
    replied, "Why do you call me good?" When we stand confronted by such
    splendid self-forgetfulness, we begin to understand how the Universal
    Father found it possible so fully to manifest himself to him and reveal
    himself through him to the mortals of the realms.

      196:0.10 Jesus brought to God, as a man of the realm, the greatest of
    all offerings: the consecration and dedication of his own will to the
    majestic service of doing the divine will. Jesus always and consistently
    interpreted religion wholly in terms of the Father's will. When you study
    the career of the Master, as concerns prayer or any other feature of the
    religious life, look not so much for what he taught as for what he did.
    Jesus never prayed as a religious duty. To him prayer was a sincere
    expression of spiritual attitude, a declaration of soul loyalty, a recital
    of personal devotion, an expression of thanksgiving, an avoidance of
    emotional tension, a prevention of conflict, an exaltation of intellection,
    an ennoblement of desire, a vindication of moral decision, an enrichment of
    thought, an invigoration of higher inclinations, a consecration of impulse,
    a clarification of viewpoint, a declaration of faith, a transcendental
    surrender of will, a sublime assertion of confidence, a revelation of
    courage, the proclamation of discovery, a confession of supreme devotion,
    the validation of consecration, a technique for the adjustment of
    difficulties, and the mighty mobilization of the combined soul powers to
    withstand all human tendencies toward selfishness, evil, and sin. He lived
    just such a life of prayerful consecration to the doing of his Father's
    will and ended his life triumphantly with just such a prayer. The secret of
    his unparalleled religious life was this consciousness of the presence of
    God; and he attained it by intelligent prayer and sincere worship --
    unbroken communion with God -- and not by leadings, voices, visions, or
    extraordinary religious practices.

      196:0.11 In the earthly life of Jesus, religion was a living experience,
    a direct and personal movement from spiritual reverence to practical
    righteousness. The faith of Jesus bore the transcendent fruits of the
    divine spirit. His faith was not immature and credulous like that of a
    child, but in many ways it did resemble the unsuspecting trust of the child
    mind. Jesus trusted God much as the child trusts a parent. He had a
    profound confidence in the universe -- just such a trust as the child has
    in its parental environment. Jesus' wholehearted faith in the fundamental
    goodness of the universe very much resembled the child's trust in the
    security of its earthly surroundings. He depended on the heavenly Father as
    a child leans upon its earthly parent, and his fervent faith never for one
    moment doubted the certainty of the heavenly Father's overcare. He was not
    disturbed seriously by fears, doubts, and skepticism. Unbelief did not
    inhibit the free and original expression of his life. He combined the
    stalwart and intelligent courage of a full-grown man with the sincere and
    trusting optimism of a believing child. His faith grew to such heights of
    trust that it was devoid of fear.

      196:0.12 The faith of Jesus attained the purity of a child's trust. His
    faith was so absolute and undoubting that it responded to the charm of the
    contact of fellow beings and to the wonders of the universe. His sense of
    dependence on the divine was so complete and so confident that it yielded
    the joy and the assurance of absolute personal security. There was no
    hesitating pretense in his religious experience. In this giant intellect of
    the full-grown man the faith of the child reigned supreme in all matters
    relating to the religious consciousness. It is not strange that he once
    said, "Except you become as a little child, you shall not enter the
    kingdom." Notwithstanding that Jesus' faith was childlike, it was in no
    sense childish.

      196:0.13 Jesus does not require his disciples to believe in him but
    rather to believe with him, believe in the reality of the love of God and
    in full confidence accept the security of the assurance of sonship with the
    heavenly Father. The Master desires that all his followers should fully
    share his transcendent faith. Jesus most touchingly challenged his
    followers, not only to believe what he believed, but also to believe as he
    believed. This is the full significance of his one supreme requirement,
    "Follow me."

      196:0.14 Jesus' earthly life was devoted to one great purpose -- doing
    the Father's will, living the human life religiously and by faith. The
    faith of Jesus was trusting, like that of a child, but it was wholly free
    from presumption. He made robust and manly decisions, courageously faced
    manifold disappointments, resolutely surmounted extraordinary difficulties,
    and unflinchingly confronted the stern requirements of duty. It required a
    strong will and an unfailing confidence to believe what Jesus believed and
    as he believed.




                                1. JESUS -- THE MAN



      196:1.1 Jesus' devotion to the Father's will and the service of man was
    even more than mortal decision and human determination; it was a
    wholehearted consecration of himself to such an unreserved bestowal of
    love. No matter how great the fact of the sovereignty of Michael, you must
    not take the human Jesus away from men. The Master has ascended on high as
    a man, as well as God; he belongs to men; men belong to him. How
    unfortunate that religion itself should be so misinterpreted as to take the
    human Jesus away from struggling mortals! Let not the discussions of the
    humanity or the divinity of the Christ obscure the saving truth that Jesus
    of Nazareth was a religious man who, by faith, achieved the knowing and the
    doing of the will of God; he was the most truly religious man who has ever
    lived on Urantia.

      196:1.2 The time is ripe to witness the figurative resurrection of the
    human Jesus from his burial tomb amidst the theological traditions and the
    religious dogmas of nineteen centuries. Jesus of Nazareth must not be
    longer sacrificed to even the splendid concept of the glorified Christ.
    What a transcendent service if, through this revelation, the Son of Man
    should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology and be presented
    as the living Jesus to the church that bears his name, and to all other
    religions! Surely the Christian fellowship of believers will not hesitate
    to make such adjustments of faith and of practices of living as will enable
    it to "follow after" the Master in the demonstration of his real life of
    religious devotion to the doing of his Father's will and of consecration to
    the unselfish service of man. Do professed Christians fear the exposure of
    a self-sufficient and unconsecrated fellowship of social respectability and
    selfish economic maladjustment? Does institutional Christianity fear the
    possible jeopardy, or even the overthrow, of traditional ecclesiastical
    authority if the Jesus of Galilee is reinstated in the minds and souls of
    mortal men as the ideal of personal religious living? Indeed, the social
    readjustments, the economic transformations, the moral rejuvenations, and
    the religious revisions of Christian civilization would be drastic and
    revolutionary if the living religion of Jesus should suddenly supplant the
    theologic religion about Jesus.



      196:1.3 To "follow Jesus" means to personally share his religious faith
    and to enter into the spirit of the Master's life of unselfish service for
    man. One of the most important things in human living is to find out what
    Jesus believed, to discover his ideals, and to strive for the achievement
    of his exalted life purpose. Of all human knowledge, that which is of
    greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it.

      196:1.4 The common people heard Jesus gladly, and they will again
    respond to the presentation of his sincere human life of consecrated
    religious motivation if such truths shall again be proclaimed to the world.
    The people heard him gladly because he was one of them, an unpretentious
    layman; the world's greatest religious teacher was indeed a layman.

      196:1.5 It should not be the aim of kingdom believers literally to
    imitate the outward life of Jesus in the flesh but rather to share his
    faith; to trust God as he trusted God and to believe in men as he believed
    in men. Jesus never argued about either the fatherhood of God or the
    brotherhood of men; he was a living illustration of the one and a profound
    demonstration of the other.

      196:1.6 Just as men must progress from the consciousness of the human to
    the realization of the divine, so did Jesus ascend from the nature of man
    to the consciousness of the nature of God. And the Master made this great
    ascent from the human to the divine by the conjoint achievement of the
    faith of his mortal intellect and the acts of his indwelling Adjuster. The
    fact-realization of the attainment of totality of divinity (all the while
    fully conscious of the reality of humanity) was attended by seven stages of
    faith consciousness of progressive divinization. These stages of
    progressive self-realization were marked off by the following extraordinary
    events in the Master's bestowal experience:

    1. The arrival of the Thought Adjuster.

    2. The messenger of Immanuel who appeared to him at Jerusalem when he was
    about twelve years old.

    3. The manifestations attendant upon his baptism.

    4. The experiences on the Mount of Transfiguration.

    5. The morontia resurrection.

    6. The spirit ascension.

    7. The final embrace of the Paradise Father, conferring unlimited
    sovereignty of his universe.




                             2. THE RELIGION OF JESUS



      196:2.1 Some day a reformation in the Christian church may strike deep
    enough to get back to the unadulterated religious teachings of Jesus, the
    author and finisher of our faith. You may preach a religion about Jesus,
    but, perforce, you must live the religion of Jesus. In the enthusiasm of
    Pentecost, Peter unintentionally inaugurated a new religion, the religion
    of the risen and glorified Christ. The Apostle Paul later on transformed
    this new gospel into Christianity, a religion embodying his own theologic
    views and portraying his own personal experience with the Jesus of the
    Damascus road. The gospel of the kingdom is founded on the personal
    religious experience of the Jesus of Galilee; Christianity is founded
    almost exclusively on the personal religious experience of the Apostle
    Paul. Almost the whole of the New Testament is devoted, not to the
    portrayal of the significant and inspiring religious life of Jesus, but to
    a discussion of Paul's religious experience and to a portrayal of his
    personal religious convictions. The only notable exceptions to this
    statement, aside from certain parts of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are the
    Book of Hebrews and the Epistle of James. Even Peter, in his writing, only
    once reverted to the personal religious life of his Master. The New
    Testament is a superb Christian document, but it is only meagerly
    Jesusonian.

      196:2.2 Jesus' life in the flesh portrays a transcendent religious
    growth from the early ideas of primitive awe and human reverence up through
    years of personal spiritual communion until he finally arrived at that
    advanced and exalted status of the consciousness of his oneness with the
    Father. And thus, in one short life, did Jesus traverse that experience of
    religious spiritual progression which man begins on earth and ordinarily
    achieves only at the conclusion of his long sojourn in the spirit training
    schools of the successive levels of the pre-Paradise career. Jesus
    progressed from a purely human consciousness of the faith certainties of
    personal religious experience to the sublime spiritual heights of the
    positive realization of his divine nature and to the consciousness of his
    close association with the Universal Father in the management of a
    universe. He progressed from the humble status of mortal dependence which
    prompted him spontaneously to say to the one who called him Good Teacher,
    "Why do you call me good? None is good but God," to that sublime
    consciousness of achieved divinity which led him to exclaim, "Which one of
    you convicts me of sin?" And this progressing ascent from the human to the
    divine was an exclusively mortal achievement. And when he had thus attained
    divinity, he was still the same human Jesus, the Son of Man as well as the
    Son of God.

      196:2.3 Mark, Matthew, and Luke retain something of the picture of the
    human Jesus as he engaged in the superb struggle to ascertain the divine
    will and to do that will. John presents a picture of the triumphant Jesus
    as he walked on earth in the full consciousness of divinity. The great
    mistake that has been made by those who have studied the Master's life is
    that some have conceived of him as entirely human, while others have
    thought of him as only divine. Throughout his entire experience he was
    truly both human and divine, even as he yet is.

      196:2.4 But the greatest mistake was made in that, while the human Jesus
    was recognized as having a religion, the divine Jesus (Christ) almost
    overnight became a religion. Paul's Christianity made sure of the adoration
    of the divine Christ, but it almost wholly lost sight of the struggling and
    valiant human Jesus of Galilee, who, by the valor of his personal religious
    faith and the heroism of his indwelling Adjuster, ascended from the lowly
    levels of humanity to become one with divinity, thus becoming the new and
    living way whereby all mortals may so ascend from humanity to divinity.
    Mortals in all stages of spirituality and on all worlds may find in the
    personal life of Jesus that which will strengthen and inspire them as they
    progress from the lowest spirit levels up to the highest divine values,
    from the beginning to the end of all personal religious experience.

      196:2.5 At the time of the writing of the New Testament, the authors not
    only most profoundly believed in the divinity of the risen Christ, but they
    also devotedly and sincerely believed in his immediate return to earth to
    consummate the heavenly kingdom. This strong faith in the Lord's immediate
    return had much to do with the tendency to omit from the record those
    references which portrayed the purely human experiences and attributes of
    the Master. The whole Christian movement tended away from the human picture
    of Jesus of Nazareth toward the exaltation of the risen Christ, the
    glorified and soon-returning Lord Jesus Christ.



      196:2.6 Jesus founded the religion of personal experience in doing the
    will of God and serving the human brotherhood; Paul founded a religion in
    which the glorified Jesus became the object of worship and the brotherhood
    consisted of fellow believers in the divine Christ. In the bestowal of
    Jesus these two concepts were potential in his divine-human life, and it is
    indeed a pity that his followers failed to create a unified religion which
    might have given proper recognition to both the human and the divine
    natures of the Master as they were inseparably bound up in his earth life
    and so gloriously set forth in the original gospel of the kingdom.

      196:2.7 You would be neither shocked nor disturbed by some of Jesus'
    strong pronouncements if you would only remember that he was the world's
    most wholehearted and devoted religionist. He was a wholly consecrated
    mortal, unreservedly dedicated to doing his Father's will. Many of his
    apparently hard sayings were more of a personal confession of faith and a
    pledge of devotion than commands to his followers. And it was this very
    singleness of purpose and unselfish devotion that enabled him to effect
    such extraordinary progress in the conquest of the human mind in one short
    life. Many of his declarations should be considered as a confession of what
    he demanded of himself rather than what he required of all his followers.
    In his devotion to the cause of the kingdom, Jesus burned all bridges
    behind him; he sacrificed all hindrances to the doing of his Father's will.

      196:2.8 Jesus blessed the poor because they were usually sincere and
    pious; he condemned the rich because they were usually wanton and
    irreligious. He would equally condemn the irreligious pauper and commend
    the consecrated and worshipful man of wealth.

      196:2.9 Jesus led men to feel at home in the world; he delivered them
    from the slavery of taboo and taught them that the world was not
    fundamentally evil. He did not long to escape from his earthly life; he
    mastered a technique of acceptably doing the Father's will while in the
    flesh. He attained an idealistic religious life in the very midst of a
    realistic world. Jesus did not share Paul's pessimistic view of humankind.
    The Master looked upon men as the sons of God and foresaw a magnificent and
    eternal future for those who chose survival. He was not a moral skeptic; he
    viewed man positively, not negatively. He saw most men as weak rather than
    wicked, more distraught than depraved. But no matter what their status,
    they were all God's children and his brethren.

      196:2.10 He taught men to place a high value upon themselves in time and
    in eternity. Because of this high estimate which Jesus placed upon men, he
    was willing to spend himself in the unremitting service of humankind. And
    it was this infinite worth of the finite that made the golden rule a vital
    factor in his religion. What mortal can fail to be uplifted by the
    extraordinary faith Jesus has in him?

      196:2.11 Jesus offered no rules for social advancement; his was a
    religious mission, and religion is an exclusively individual experience.
    The ultimate goal of society's most advanced achievement can never hope to
    transcend Jesus' brotherhood of men based on the recognition of the
    fatherhood of God. The ideal of all social attainment can be realized only
    in the coming of this divine kingdom.




                           3. THE SUPREMACY OF RELIGION



      196:3.1 Personal, spiritual religious experience is an efficient solvent
    for most mortal difficulties; it is an effective sorter, evaluator, and
    adjuster of all human problems. Religion does not remove or destroy human
    troubles, but it does dissolve, absorb, illuminate, and transcend them.
    True religion unifies the personality for effective adjustment to all
    mortal requirements. Religious faith -- the positive leading of the
    indwelling divine presence -- unfailingly enables the God-knowing man to
    bridge that gulf existing between the intellectual logic which recognizes
    the Universal First Cause as It and those positive affirmations of the soul
    which aver this First Cause is He, the heavenly Father of Jesus' gospel,
    the personal God of human salvation.

      196:3.2 There are just three elements in universal reality: fact, idea,
    and relation. The religious consciousness identifies these realities as
    science, philosophy, and truth. Philosophy would be inclined to view these
    activities as reason, wisdom, and faith -- physical reality, intellectual
    reality, and spiritual reality. We are in the habit of designating these
    realities as thing, meaning, and value.

      196:3.3 The progressive comprehension of reality is the equivalent of
    approaching God. The finding of God, the consciousness of identity with
    reality, is the equivalent of the experiencing of self-completion --
    self-entirety, self-totality. The experiencing of total reality is the full
    realization of God, the finality of the God-knowing experience.

      196:3.4 The full summation of human life is the knowledge that man is
    educated by fact, ennobled by wisdom, and saved -- justified -- by
    religious faith.

      196:3.5 Physical certainty consists in the logic of science; moral
    certainty, in the wisdom of philosophy; spiritual certainty, in the truth
    of genuine religious experience.

      196:3.6 The mind of man can attain high levels of spiritual insight and
    corresponding spheres of divinity of values because it is not wholly
    material. There is a spirit nucleus in the mind of man -- the Adjuster of
    the divine presence. There are three separate evidences of this spirit
    indwelling of the human mind:



      196:3.7 1. Humanitarian fellowship -- love. The purely animal mind may
    be gregarious for self-protection, but only the spirit-indwelt intellect is
    unselfishly altruistic and unconditionally loving.



      196:3.8 2. Interpretation of the universe -- wisdom. Only the
    spirit-indwelt mind can comprehend that the universe is friendly to the
    individual.



      196:3.9 3. Spiritual evaluation of life -- worship. Only the
    spirit-indwelt man can realize the divine presence and seek to attain a
    fuller experience in and with this foretaste of divinity.



      196:3.10 The human mind does not create real values; human experience
    does not yield universe insight. Concerning insight, the recognition of
    moral values and the discernment of spiritual meanings, all that the human
    mind can do is to discover, recognize, interpret, and choose.

      196:3.11 The moral values of the universe become intellectual
    possessions by the exercise of the three basic judgments, or choices, of
    the mortal mind:

    1. Self-judgment -- moral choice.

    2. Social-judgment -- ethical choice.

    3. God-judgment -- religious choice.

      196:3.12 Thus it appears that all human progress is effected by a
    technique of conjoint revelational evolution.

      196:3.13 Unless a divine lover lived in man, he could not unselfishly
    and spiritually love. Unless an interpreter lived in the mind, man could
    not truly realize the unity of the universe. Unless an evaluator dwelt with
    man, he could not possibly appraise moral values and recognize spiritual
    meanings. And this lover hails from the very source of infinite love; this
    interpreter is a part of Universal Unity; this evaluator is the child of
    the Center and Source of all absolute values of divine and eternal reality.

      196:3.14 Moral evaluation with a religious meaning -- spiritual insight
    -- connotes the individual's choice between good and evil, truth and error,
    material and spiritual, human and divine, time and eternity. Human survival
    is in great measure dependent on consecrating the human will to the
    choosing of those values selected by this spirit-value sorter -- the
    indwelling interpreter and unifier. Personal religious experience consists
    in two phases: discovery in the human mind and revelation by the indwelling
    divine spirit. Through oversophistication or as a result of the irreligious
    conduct of professed religionists, a man, or even a generation of men, may
    elect to suspend their efforts to discover the God who indwells them; they
    may fail to progress in and attain the divine revelation. But such
    attitudes of spiritual nonprogression cannot long persist because of the
    presence and influence of the indwelling Thought Adjusters.

      196:3.15 This profound experience of the reality of the divine
    indwelling forever transcends the crude materialistic technique of the
    physical sciences. You cannot put spiritual joy under a microscope; you
    cannot weigh love in a balance; you cannot measure moral values; neither
    can you estimate the quality of spiritual worship.

      196:3.16 The Hebrews had a religion of moral sublimity; the Greeks
    evolved a religion of beauty; Paul and his conferees founded a religion of
    faith, hope, and charity. Jesus revealed and exemplified a religion of
    love: security in the Father's love, with joy and satisfaction consequent
    upon sharing this love in the service of the human brotherhood.

      196:3.17 Every time man makes a reflective moral choice, he immediately
    experiences a new divine invasion of his soul. Moral choosing constitutes
    religion as the motive of inner response to outer conditions. But such a
    real religion is not a purely subjective experience. It signifies the whole
    of the subjectivity of the individual engaged in a meaningful and
    intelligent response to total objectivity -- the universe and its Maker.

      196:3.18 The exquisite and transcendent experience of loving and being
    loved is not just a psychic illusion because it is so purely subjective.
    The one truly divine and objective reality that is associated with mortal
    beings, the Thought Adjuster, functions to human observation apparently as
    an exclusively subjective phenomenon. Man's contact with the highest
    objective reality, God, is only through the purely subjective experience of
    knowing him, of worshiping him, of realizing sonship with him.

      196:3.19 True religious worship is not a futile monologue of
    self-deception. Worship is a personal communion with that which is divinely
    real, with that which is the very source of reality. Man aspires by worship
    to be better and thereby eventually attains the best.

      196:3.20 The idealization and attempted service of truth, beauty, and
    goodness is not a substitute for genuine religious experience -- spiritual
    reality. Psychology and idealism are not the equivalent of religious
    reality. The projections of the human intellect may indeed originate false
    gods -- gods in man's image -- but the true God-consciousness does not have
    such an origin. The God-consciousness is resident in the indwelling spirit.
    Many of the religious systems of man come from the formulations of the
    human intellect, but the God-consciousness is not necessarily a part of
    these grotesque systems of religious slavery.

      196:3.21 God is not the mere invention of man's idealism; he is the very
    source of all such superanimal insights and values. God is not a hypothesis
    formulated to unify the human concepts of truth, beauty, and goodness; he
    is the personality of love from whom all of these universe manifestations
    are derived. The truth, beauty, and goodness of man's world are unified by
    the increasing spirituality of the experience of mortals ascending toward
    Paradise realities. The unity of truth, beauty, and goodness can only be
    realized in the spiritual experience of the God-knowing personality.

      196:3.22 Morality is the essential pre-existent soil of personal
    God-consciousness, the personal realization of the Adjuster's inner
    presence, but such morality is not the source of religious experience and
    the resultant spiritual insight. The moral nature is superanimal but
    subspiritual. Morality is equivalent to the recognition of duty, the
    realization of the existence of right and wrong. The moral zone intervenes
    between the animal and the human types of mind as morontia functions
    between the material and the spiritual spheres of personality attainment.

      196:3.23 The evolutionary mind is able to discover law, morals, and
    ethics; but the bestowed spirit, the indwelling Adjuster, reveals to the
    evolving human mind the lawgiver, the Father-source of all that is true,
    beautiful, and good; and such an illuminated man has a religion and is
    spiritually equipped to begin the long and adventurous search for God.

      196:3.24 Morality is not necessarily spiritual; it may be wholly and
    purely human, albeit real religion enhances all moral values, makes them
    more meaningful. Morality without religion fails to reveal ultimate
    goodness, and it also fails to provide for the survival of even its own
    moral values. Religion provides for the enhancement, glorification, and
    assured survival of everything morality recognizes and approves.

      196:3.25 Religion stands above science, art, philosophy, ethics, and
    morals, but not independent of them. They are all indissolubly interrelated
    in human experience, personal and social. Religion is man's supreme
    experience in the mortal nature, but finite language makes it forever
    impossible for theology ever adequately to depict real religious
    experience.

      196:3.26 Religious insight possesses the power of turning defeat into
    higher desires and new determinations. Love is the highest motivation which
    man may utilize in his universe ascent. But love, divested of truth,
    beauty, and goodness, is only a sentiment, a philosophic distortion, a
    psychic illusion, a spiritual deception. Love must always be redefined on
    successive levels of morontia and spirit progression.

      196:3.27 Art results from man's attempt to escape from the lack of
    beauty in his material environment; it is a gesture toward the morontia
    level. Science is man's effort to solve the apparent riddles of the
    material universe. Philosophy is man's attempt at the unification of human
    experience. Religion is man's supreme gesture, his magnificent reach for
    final reality, his determination to find God and to be like him.

      196:3.28 In the realm of religious experience, spiritual possibility is
    potential reality. Man's forward spiritual urge is not a psychic illusion.
    All of man's universe romancing may not be fact, but much, very much, is
    truth.



      196:3.29 Some men's lives are too great and noble to descend to the low
    level of being merely successful. The animal must adapt itself to the
    environment, but the religious man transcends his environment and in this
    way escapes the limitations of the present material world through this
    insight of divine love. This concept of love generates in the soul of man
    that superanimal effort to find truth, beauty, and goodness; and when he
    does find them, he is glorified in their embrace; he is consumed with the
    desire to live them, to do righteousness.



      196:3.30 Be not discouraged; human evolution is still in progress, and
    the revelation of God to the world, in and through Jesus, shall not fail.



      196:3.31 The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better
    communication with the divine Monitor that dwells within the human mind.
    Man's greatest adventure in the flesh consists in the well-balanced and
    sane effort to advance the borders of self-consciousness out through the
    dim realms of embryonic soul-consciousness in a wholehearted effort to
    reach the borderland of spirit-consciousness -- contact with the divine
    presence. Such an experience constitutes God-consciousness, an experience
    mightily confirmative of the pre-existent truth of the religious experience
    of knowing God. Such spirit-consciousness is the equivalent of the
    knowledge of the actuality of sonship with God. Otherwise, the assurance of
    sonship is the experience of faith.

      196:3.32 And God-consciousness is equivalent to the integration of the
    self with the universe, and on its highest levels of spiritual reality.
    Only the spirit content of any value is imperishable. Even that which is
    true, beautiful, and good may not perish in human experience. If man does
    not choose to survive, then does the surviving Adjuster conserve those
    realities born of love and nurtured in service. And all these things are a
    part of the Universal Father. The Father is living love, and this life of
    the Father is in his Sons. And the spirit of the Father is in his Son's
    sons -- mortal men. When all is said and done, the Father idea is still the
    highest human concept of God.
