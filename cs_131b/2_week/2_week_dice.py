This program simulates throwing two 900-sided dice, then indicates whether or not the sum of the results is divisible by three.

I am assuming that I will not ask for user input, and the user will run the program directly from the terminal to throw the dice. 

I am also deciding that my 900-sided dice include the options 1-900, inclusive.
